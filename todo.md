## Bug Notes
* Daily Bar Chart: If no auctions are closed with a specific fish type, that fish type is not represented on the x axis and not in the drop down select. If there are closed auctions but none in that category were sold, then there is an x axis label with a bar height of 0.

* Bar Chart: Needs a space between number and text info, on tooltip mouseover.
