# TO DO:
* Provide button for drop down// Doesnt feel good...
* Find better organization for graphs and everything



# SOMETIMES Firebase doesn't return in time, or returns too fast
	* This causes errors with value in portfolio being displayed and login name


* After sign up, should redircet back to home page
* Add link for leaderboard in nav

## Game:
* write Portfolio maintainer auto updater for recording account values over time

* Make line for portfolio

* Make a profile page

## Leaderboard page
* Style
* Include cash and avg? Make this a table?



## Line Graph
* Associate lines and colors

## Scraper:
* Links to fish closed auction pages, or maybe just images?

## Bug Notes
* Daily Bar Chart: If no auctions are closed with a specific fish type, that fish type is not represented on the x axis and not in the drop down select. If there are closed auctions but none in that category were sold, then there is an x axis label with a bar height of 0.
