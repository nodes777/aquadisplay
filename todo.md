# TO DO:

# SOMETIMES Firebase doesn't return in time, or returns too fast
* This causes errors with value in portfolio being displayed and login name

## Game:

* Paid, Dollar Change, and Percent Change are not implemented correctly - DOuble check, this may be fixed after updating makeSale to edit p[fishType].paid

* Make fades on changes to portfolio, on individual cells (Must check if that cell already exists, find it, fade it and change it)

## Leaderboard page
* Style
* Include cash and avg? Make this a table?
* Value is only updated once a day, not after making trades ?BUG?
* Add line graph for top 10 players

## Line Graph
* Associate lines and colors

## Scraper:
* Links to fish closed auction pages, or maybe just images?

## Bug Notes
* Daily Bar Chart: If no auctions are closed with a specific fish type, that fish type is not represented on the x axis and not in the drop down select. If there are closed auctions but none in that category were sold, then there is an x axis label with a bar height of 0.
