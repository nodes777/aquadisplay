          <h2>About Aquatrader</h2>
          <p>Aquatrader is a stock market trading game, but instead of trading stock, you trade categories of fish based on real sales from <a href="https://aquabid.com">aquabid.com</a>.</p>

          <h2>How to Play</h2>
          <p>After <a href="./signup.html"> creating an account</a> and logging in. Each player starts with $500 in cash. This amount can be used to buy different stocks of fish. Prices change each day based on the average of all sales from the previous day. As you buy and sell fish stocks, the value of your portfolio will change. The goal is to have the most value of all players displayed on the <a href="./leaderboard.html">leaderboard</a>. </p>

	        <h3>About the Project</h3>
	        <p>I made this as a personal project as a way to learn how to <a href="https://medium.com/@Tnodes/all-i-wanted-to-do-is-scrape-in-javascript-c329c8e757e3"> scrape in JavaScript</a> and to learn D3.js. The categories of fish are defined by aquabid. Fish sales data is from <a href="https://aquabid.com">aquabid.com</a> and is updated each night at 12:30am PST.</p>
	        <h4>Notes</h4>
	        <p>Previously, the data being displayed for the <a href="http://www.aquabid.com/cgi-bin/auction/closed.cgi">closed auctions on aquabid</a>, after selecting "view 1 previous day", included sales that have been sold before their close date. This allowed a single sale to remain as a data point for multiple days. This has been fixed as of February 22nd 2018. Sales are now sorted to display only the day of sale. Dates after this point accurately reflect sales made on that day.</p>
	        <p> <strong>Regarding scraping:</strong> as of January 2018, <a href="http://www.aquabid.com/robots.txt">aquabid's robots.txt</a> only prevents automated browsing on the "/cgi-bin/auction/vfb.cgi" pages. Presumably, this is to avoid automated bid making.</p>
	        <p>This site's <a href="https://github.com/nodes777/aquadisplay">github.</a></p>
	        <p>Raw data is available publicly from a Firebase with instructions on the <a href="https://github.com/nodes777/aquascraper">scraper's github.</a></p>
